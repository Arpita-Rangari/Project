 CoachPro - A Facilitation tool for online coaching platforms.
Dedicated Repo for Project Named "CoachPro"
<hr>

Objective: The main aim of this project is to make a fully functional online course store system that allows its users to search and purchase a course online based on category. The Actros in the Facilitation tool for online coaching platforms are divided into two categories, one is the front user, and another one is the background user (Admin). Front-end users are mainly customers who will buy courses. Front-end users can register, log in, search the courses, add the courses to the shopping cart and enrol in courses. The background user (Admin) can add, modify or delete the course details, and can add the latest courses. Also, the admin will be able to manage categories i.e.  add, update, and delete categories as per requirement.

Behaviour Driven development is being used for the development process. Hence Project is based upon Agile methodology.
